I want to formally apologize for using global variables. I was thinking about refacotring it to use addresses instead,
but didn't want to risk creating a bug.

Here's a deal I propose:

You don't take off any points for me using globals this time, but if you ever catch me doing it again, you can fail me.

Let me know what you think.

Also, please be kind about me failing the binary test case. I spent a good amount of time trying to find out the issue, but 
given the nature of the data we are working with in that file, I found it incredably difficult to debug.

Thanks,

Nick
